A Postgres database is required

Pull a Postgres server image with `docker`.

```shell
docker pull postgres:latest
```{{execute}}

Create a Postgres database with a root user named `root` with the password
`rootpassword`.

```shell
docker run \
      --name postgres \
      --env POSTGRES_USER=root \
      --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rootpassword \
      --detach  \
      --publish 5432:5432 \
      postgres
```{{execute}}

The database is available.

The credentials generated by the Vault role require a role named `ro` that has
been granted the ability to read all tables.

Connect to the Postgres database via the CLI within the `postgres` container.

```shell
docker exec -it postgres psql
```{{execute}}

Your system prompt is replaced with a new prompt `root=#`. Commands issued at
this prompt are executed against the Postgres database running within the
container.

Create a role named `ro`.

```shell
CREATE ROLE ro NOINHERIT;
```{{execute}}

Grant the ability to read all tables to the role named `ro`.

```shell
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "ro";
```{{execute}}

The role is created and assigned the appropriate permissions.

Disconnect from the Postgres database.

```shell
\q
```{{execute}}
